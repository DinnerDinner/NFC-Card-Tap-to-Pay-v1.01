NFC-Android-Tap-to-Pay-with-Wallet
This project centers around the development of a modern digital wallet application that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions through NFC card interactions, without depending on traditional payment processors or external hardware readers. At its core, the app enables users to deposit funds from their real-world bank accounts into a virtual in-app wallet, then use that wallet to conduct local, tap-based transactions with other users. The system circumvents PCI compliance complexities by never handling raw card data; instead, it relies on passive NFC detection for identification, while all actual money movement is handled via internal account logic and basic external bank APIs.

Upon onboarding, users create a wallet account and manually input their basic financial information (e.g., account number, routing number, or IBAN), which enables the platform to facilitate incoming and outgoing bank transfers. These transfers are strictly limited to wallet top-ups and withdrawals. No real-time card charging or direct interaction with the card networks (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) is performed, meaning the app avoids any sensitive handling of PANs (Primary Account Numbers), CVVs, or magnetic stripe data.

After initial registration, the app prompts users to tap their physical or virtual NFC-enabled debit/credit card. This interaction is not for transaction processing but for account identification: the app reads a low-level, non-sensitive NFC identifier (such as a UID or hash of the card’s serial/token) and links this to the user’s wallet account in a secure, encrypted internal database. From that point forward, any time the user taps their card on a device running the app, the software matches the NFC identifier to the wallet it belongs to, enabling a seamless, tap-to-pay simulation — without processing anything through the card rails. The transaction flow is simple and consistent. A user (merchant) initiates a payment request by entering a requested amount. The payer then taps their card (virtual or physical), which the app identifies and links to their wallet account. If there are sufficient funds in the payer’s in-app balance, the app deducts the amount and instantly credits it to the merchant’s wallet account — all within the app’s internal ledger. Both parties receive transaction logs and confirmations within the app interface. The money remains inside the system until users manually transfer it back to their connected bank accounts, using the account details previously provided.

This design enables a fast, secure, and hardware-free alternative to conventional NFC-based payment terminals by separating card identity from money movement. It simulates real-world peer-to-peer contactless payments using wallet-based logic, without ever touching sensitive financial credentials or requiring certification from card networks. The wallet app itself features a clean, serious interface resembling a traditional banking or PayPal-style UI, with screens for balances, transaction history, money transfers, and payment collection. Every card tap interaction, payment request, and balance update is logged, auditable, and handled in real-time on the cloud.

The key innovation lies in combining NFC-based identity confirmation with internal, app-contained balance shifting. This enables realistic peer-to-peer tap transactions while maintaining legal and architectural simplicity. It empowers developers and testers to create fully functioning mock-fintech experiences — and potentially, with further security infrastructure, evolve into a real-world peer payment product.
